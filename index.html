            <p>Welcome to my website!</p>
            <p>I'm still working things out here, as you can see. I feel the need to create an about page and a landing
                page,
                though I don't yet know what might be interesting to share about myself, or what sort of things ought to
                go on a
                landing page, so for now I hope this will suffice.</p>
            <p>The site is intentionally minimal, as I have a tendency to overcomplicate things, and I want to focus on
                publishing insightful content rather than obsess over layouts and design. I am also trying to put my
                ideas out
                there and iterate quickly so for the first version of the site I have decided to only work on a few
                things:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>This short introduction explaining my thought process</li>
                <li>A <a href="/contact.html">contact form</a> so that anyone reading this can make suggestions or just
                    let me know what if anything
                    you
                    found valuable (I would really appreciate it).</li>
                <li>A list of posts which I'm allowing to be less so complete articles and more short thoughts to see
                    what
                    people are interested in.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>I plan to update this site fairly often as I develop my ideas about what I want to do with it, and I plan
                to
                document the though process behind many of these changes. In essence, this site represents a record of
                my
                thoughts, which is as much for my only clarity of mind than anything else.</p>
            <p>Feel free to check back later to see if I've made any changes or added some new content. If you have
                manage to
                find this site by some miraculous then drop me a line using the <a href="/contact.html">contact
                    form</a>: introduce yourself, make a
                suggestion, tell me about something you've learnt, whatever you want.</p>
