                <p>I've often been called pretentious.</p>
                <p>Not in a particularly offensive way, and indeed not normally
                    in
                    reference to the way I am in my everyday life, but more so in the way that I write.</p>
                <p>I think this may be a common fear when people first begin writing. Every line seems too forward or
                    presumptuous. Even the idea that anyone may find what you have to say seems self-indulgent, and
                    indeed it might be. However, I don't think that this should stop us from writing.</p>
                <p>Writing is a craft which takes practice to develop, and finding your voice is part of that. In this
                    way it seems inevitable that we will all come off as pretentious in the beginning. It's not that we
                    are intentionally putting up a pretense, but rather that we haven't found our style yet.</p>
                <p>Oftentimes someone seems pretentious when they appear to use excessively complicated language to give
                    the impression of intelligence when really they have nothing to say. However, this is fine. It seems
                    to me that the first step is to get your thoughts down on paper and then you can refine them into
                    their essences.</p>
                <p>On one occassion I was told something I had written was too pretentious, the person giving the
                    feedback admitted that he too had often been told the same thing, and he told me that the main skill
                    of a good thinker or writer is to explain complex ideas in simple terms. This is no easy task,
                    however it seems that we can only get better by practicing.</p>
